I'd be happy to create a login system using RedBeanPHP! RedBeanPHP is a great ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for PHP that makes database interactions simple and intuitive. Let me create a complete login system for you using RedBeanPHP.

I've created a complete login system using RedBeanPHP for you! The system includes user registration, login, and session management functionality.

## What I've Created

1. **Core Login System** (`login_system.php`):
   - Database connection setup with RedBeanPHP
   - User registration with validation
   - Secure password hashing
   - Login functionality
   - Session management
   - Helper functions for checking login status

2. **HTML Templates**:
   - `register.php`: User registration form
   - `login.php`: Login form
   - `dashboard.php`: Protected page for logged-in users
   - `logout.php`: Handles logging out

## How to Set Up

1. **Install RedBeanPHP** using Composer:
   ```
   composer require gabordemooij/redbean
   ```

2. **Configure the Database**:
   - In the `setupDatabase()` function, update the database credentials:
     ```php
     R::setup('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=login_system', 'username', 'password');
     ```

3. **File Structure**:
   - Save the first code block as `login_system.php`
   - Save the HTML templates as their respective filenames
   - Make sure all files are in the same directory

## Security Features

- Passwords are securely hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` with the default algorithm
- Protection against SQL injection through RedBeanPHP's parameterized queries
- Input validation on registration and login
- Consistent error messages that don't reveal whether a username exists
- Session management for authenticated users

## Development vs. Production

- During development, RedBeanPHP will automatically create tables and columns as needed
- For production, you should set `R::freeze(true)` to prevent database structure modifications

This system provides a solid foundation that you can easily extend with additional features like password reset, email verification, or user roles.
